# ECI-Candidate-Management-System
The ECI Candidate Management System is a console based project designed to streamline the process of managing electoral candidates. It allows administrators to easily **add**, **update**, **delete**, and **insert** candidate information, making it easier to maintain an accurate and up-to-date candidate list for elections.
